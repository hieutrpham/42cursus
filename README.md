## 1. ft_printf

`ft_printf` is my custom implementation of the `printf` function from the C standard library. This project involved recreating the core functionalities of `printf`, including handling various format specifiers (e.g., `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%x`, `%p`), flags, field width, and precision. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of variadic functions, argument parsing, and string manipulation in C.

## 2. get_next_line

`get_next_line` is a function designed to read a line from a file descriptor, ending with a newline character (`\n`) or End-Of-File (EOF). This project focuses on efficient file reading, handling static variables to maintain context across multiple calls, and managing buffer overflows. It's a fundamental utility for parsing text files line by line, demonstrating proper resource management and error handling.

## 3. libft

`libft` is my personal C library, a collection of useful functions that I've re-implemented or created from scratch. It serves as a foundational toolkit for many of my other C projects, providing essential utilities for string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and more. This project emphasizes good coding practices, modularity, and a deep understanding of basic C operations, serving as a valuable resource for future development.
